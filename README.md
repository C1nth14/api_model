# api_model


This project includes a single country model that takes a single country and returns information related to the said country. This is using the REST countries API (https://restcountries.com/)

The information that I chose for this model answers the following questions:

1. What are the country's official and native names?
3. What currencies are used?
4. What is the country's capital city?
5. What subregion of the world is it found?
6. What languages do they speak?
7. Whether the country is landlocked or not. This returns a boolean value of True or False
8. What side of the road do they drive in that country?
9. What continent is the country found?


This project has four python files which are:
1. single_name_model.py - This has the model that holds the data to answer the above questions
2. single_name.py - This holds the request for the information from the REST countries API
3. main_user.py - This is the file for the user to input the name of the country by creating an object using the SingleName class
4. practice_api.py - This is the file used when creating the model to explore the API and the data included in the queries.
